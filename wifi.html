			<p>To use the network, register the MAC address of your device with the HackNC organizers before or during the event.</p>
			<h2>UNC-PSK</h2>
			<p>UNC-PSK is available if for whatever reason you cannot use UNC-SECURE, it uses a shared secret key instead of a certificate.  Ask an organizer for the password if you are unable to connect to UNC-SECURE.</p>
			<h2>UNC-Guest</h2>
			<p>This is the public "guest" network, requiring no password.  Access on this network is limited to web and a few other protocols, and to the internet outside the unc.edu domain.</p>
			<h2>Ethernet</h2>
			<p>This is the simplest, and fastest, option for anyone who doesn't want to worry about passwords.  Note that you must still register your MAC address.</p>
			<h2>UNC-SECURE</h2>
			<p>UNC-Secure is the primary wireless network for UNC students, <a class="external-link" href="http://help.unc.edu/CCM3_008509">configuration instructions</a> are provided by ITS.</p>
